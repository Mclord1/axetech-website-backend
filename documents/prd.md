# AxeTech Innovations Website PRD

## 1. Overview

**Project Name:** AxeTech Innovations Website

**Company:** AxeTech Innovations

AxeTech Innovations is launching its online presence to showcase its expertise in web and mobile product development, design projects, AI automation, and lead generation. The website will also serve as a platform for future proprietary products and a showcase of completed projects. Notably, the frontend will be split into two parts—a visitor-facing landing page and an admin CMS for content management—both developed in Vue.js and connected to backend APIs.
